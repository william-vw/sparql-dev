## Abstract
I recently noticed unintuitive behavior when using reverse properties in NegatedPropertySets. 
The [translation to the SPARQL algebra](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlTranslatePathExpressions) means that a single NegatedPropertySet that mixes non-reverse and reverse IRI's essentially issues two separate queries.

This is not necessarily an enhancement proposal, but rather describes this behavior and why I find it unintuitive.

## Motivation
This query example:
```
PREFIX :   <http://example.org/>
:x0 :p1 :x1 .
:x0 :p2 :x1 .
:x2 :p :x3 .

PREFIX :   <http://example.org/>
SELECT * { ?x0 !( :p1 | :p2 ) ?x1 . }
```

Results in pairs of terms that are not connected through either `:p1` or `:p2`, namely:  
`:x2`, `:x3`

For this query example:
```
PREFIX :   <http://example.org/>
:x3 :p1 :x2 .
:x2 :p :x3 .

PREFIX :   <http://example.org/>
SELECT * { ?x0 !( :p1 | ^:p1 ) ?x1 . }
```
As a result, I would similarly expect pairs of terms that are not connected either through `:p1` or inversely through `:p1`.
I.e., I wouldn't expect any results here.

Instead, it returns `:x2, :x3` and `:x3, :x2`, which **do not** meet the above description: `:x2, :x3` are inversely connected through `:p1`, and `:x3, :x2` are connected through `:p1`.

It is clear why: due to its [algebra translation](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#sparqlTranslatePathExpressions), this type of expression essentially issues two queries:
- return all x0's and x1's that are not connected through `:p1` (here, `:x2, :x3`), and 
- return all x0's and x1's that are not inversely connected through `:p1` (here, `:x3, :x2`).

I am not necessarily advocating to change this behaviour (which may have widespread implications for SPARQL implementations).

But, I am wondering whether others also find this behaviour unintuitive; if so, whether they believe it should be fixed, or a note should be added to the specification.
